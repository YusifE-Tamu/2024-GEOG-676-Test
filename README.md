## Environmental Buffers Tool Documentation

### Purpose
The Environmental Buffers Tool is designed to create buffer zones around polygon and/or polyline features and optionally dissolve these buffers. It's useful for identifying areas of influence or impact around geographical features.
Tool Parameters

- Input Features: Polygon and/or polyline features to be buffered (multiple inputs allowed).
- Buffer Distance: The distance to buffer the input features (e.g., 50 Meters).
- Dissolve Buffers: Option to merge (dissolve) the buffered areas.
- Dissolve Field: (Optional) Field to use for dissolving, if buffers are to be dissolved.
- Output Feature Class: Location and name for the resulting buffered (and optionally dissolved) features.

### How It Works

- Initialization: The tool sets up the necessary parameters and interfaces with ArcGIS Pro.
- Parameter Handling: Validates and retrieves user inputs.
- Enables/disables the dissolve field option based on whether dissolve is selected.


### Execution:

Buffers the input features using the specified distance.

If dissolve is selected:
Dissolves the buffered features (either all together or based on a specified field).
Replaces the original buffer output with the dissolved result.

Error Handling: Catches and reports any errors that occur during execution.
Output: Creates a new feature class containing the buffered (and optionally dissolved) features.

### Usage

Open the tool in ArcGIS Pro.
Select input polygon and/or polyline features.
Specify the buffer distance.
Choose whether to dissolve buffers.
If dissolving, optionally select a field to dissolve by.
Specify the output location and name.
Run the tool.

#### Notes

The tool can handle both polygon and polyline inputs simultaneously.
If dissolve is not selected, the output will be individual buffers around each input feature.
Progress messages are displayed in both the Python console and the ArcGIS Pro geoprocessing pane.
